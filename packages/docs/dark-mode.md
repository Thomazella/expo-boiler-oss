## Dark and light mode

This app uses react-native's `Appearance.getColorScheme()` and two themes to switch colors matching the phone OS

### iOS Simulator

To change OS theme (requires iOS 13+) do

`Settings > Developer > Dark appearance toggle`

### Android Emulator

To change OS theme (requires Android 9+) do

`Settings > Display > Dark theme toggle`

The app should adapt itself
